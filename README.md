# **ETOX**
## Objective

- Write a program that first prompts the user for a value of x, reads x (as a double) and then computes and prints the value of ex without using either of the methods exp or pow from the Math class. The value of ex is given by the following power series

- In computing the value of ex, your program should continue to add terms of the power series until it reaches a term whose absolute value is less than 10-15 times the absolute value of the sum of the previous terms.
The symbol n! is read as n factorial. If n is a positive integer, then
